- Capture window via Display capture method

Allows OBS capture overlay or GPU/hardware accelerated window.


Works like full screen capture with auto crop.

- Adjustable scale option for high DPI display

Prevent invalid scale causing black region when OBS couldn't get correct DPI setting from program.


## Notice
Caution! Other window or UI could cover the capture.

## Installation 
replace` win-capture.dll` under `obs-plugins\64bit` folder
